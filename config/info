Application configuration including environment-specific configs


Configuration

Krakenâ€™s configuration can be found in the config/config.json file.

This JSON file contains key value pairs that are loaded at runtime.
The advantage of this is that all your application configuration is in a single, well-known place;
and you can swap it out without having to touch a single line of code.

This config file is also where you can define middleware and specify its load-order. To find out more, check out meddleware.

Development vs. Production environments

A common scenario is that development environments have slightly different parameters than production.
 Kraken allows you to define a second file config/development.json with alternate values.

You can control which file is loaded by defining an environment variable: NODE_ENV and setting its value to production
or development as appropriate.
