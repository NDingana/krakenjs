Server and browser-side templates

Kraken uses LinkedInâ€™s Dust as the templating language of choice.
Adaro is the module responsible for rendering and managing the templates.


Templates are loaded from the public/templates directory. Because they reside in the public folder,
this allows kraken to use the same templates on the server side as well as the client side, allowing you to reuse code.

If we wanted to greet our customers, a basic template would be:

<h1>Hello {name}!</h1>
