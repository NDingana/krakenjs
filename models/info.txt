Models

Kraken follows a complete decoupling of application logic, data and presentation.
The convention to follow is that any data model objects should be placed in this folder, along with any functionality
that they require (Retrieval from a database, class specific functions, etc.)
The basic application creates a models/index.js model that simply returns the application name for display.

Kraken also separates data models from the controller logic, resulting in cleaner, more organized code.

Data models live in the models folder.

When a new controller is created, the framework will also create a simple model for you
